# OD-2: Create functional requirements document

## Notes

I'll analyze this Jira sub-task and the repository to understand what's needed.

The task is to create a functional requirements document. Let me first explore the repository structure to understand the project context.

<repository_exploration>
<list_files>
.
</list_files>
</repository_exploration>

<repository_exploration>
<read_file>
<path>.</path>
</read_file>
</repository_exploration>

Let me check if there are any existing files in the repository:

<repository_exploration>
<search_files>
<pattern>*</pattern>
</search_files>
</repository_exploration>

<repository_exploration>
<list_files>
<path>.</path>
<recursive>true</recursive>
</list_files>
</repository_exploration>

Based on the Jira sub-task, I need to create a functional requirements document. However, the description is empty, which means I don't have specific requirements to document. Let me check if there are any related Jira tasks or project documentation that might provide context.

Since the description is completely empty and there's no additional context provided, I need to ask clarifying questions before proceeding:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    "What is the project/system that this functional requirements document should cover?",
    "What are the key features or functionalities that need to be documented?",
    "Are there any existing specifications, user stories, or stakeholder requirements that should be referenced?",
    "What is the intended audience for this document (developers, stakeholders, QA team)?",
    "What format/template should be used for the functional requirements document (IEEE standard, custom template, markdown, etc.)?",
    "Are there any specific sections that must be included (use cases, user stories, acceptance criteria, etc.)?",
    "Is there a parent epic or related tasks (like OD-1, OD-3) that provide context about what this project is about?"
  ]
}
```
